# FlyBuy
This was my first project using .NET Framework to create a website. The projct was created using ASP.NET MVC pattern and some of functionalities that it has are :

User based

- A user can Register/Login/Log Out

- User can navigate products depending on which category he wants for example age category or clothing category

- User can sort products by category,price and rating

- User can add a product in the cart or clear the cart

- User can check out

- User can leave a comment for the page which it will be displayed at the main layout


Admin Based

- Admin can Login/Log out

- Admin can add/edit/delete anything in website for ex. products,categories etc

- Admin can see all the orders made by users

- Overall it was a good experience and i learned a lot about C# and .NET in general.
